	<h2 style="text-align: center"><b>WHY KNOWN AS PRAYAG</b></h2>
	<p style="padding-left: 10px"><b><i> Allahabad was named so in 1575 by Mughal Emperor Akbar, who called it, Illahabas meaning the abode of God. Before Akbar rechristened it, Allahabad was known as Prayag. ... It is believed that Brahma, the creator of universe, performed or attended a sacrificial ritual at Prayag.Some texts relate this place with the son-in-law of Lord Shiva and Parvati who ruled over this place before moving to the Sapta Saindhav region. His name was Yayati. He was married to Ashokasundari, the daughter of Parvati and Lord Shiva.The Sapta Saindhav region is the most referred place in Rig Veda. It is the area captured by Indus and now extinct mystical river Saraswati and their tributaries. Yayati had five sons, who went on to give the five most prominent tribes mentioned in Rig Veda.The association of Allahabad or Prayag with the Kumbh Mela is old. It was also known as Magh Mela. But its antiquity is not certain. Chinese Hiuen Tsang mentions about it in his memoir. Hiuen Tsang talks about an ancient annual fair being held at Prayag in 644 AD.</i></b></p>
